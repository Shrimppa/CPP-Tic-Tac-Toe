# Overview
I created Tic-Tac-Toe in C++ so I could learn the language, so I could get used to it's syntax, and with how it works.

This software was written to demonstrate knowledge of class creation within C++, and how to work within the language.

I wrote this software because I wanted to learn C++, so I could futher my knowledge of programming.
